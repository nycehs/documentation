You can create new posts in this site by copying a markdown file in the `_posts` folder. Use the same file naming convention - `YYYY-MM-DD-title.markdown`

Edit the file in a text editor like Notepad++. Update the "front matter" - in a text editor, look at the top of the page, and see things like layout, title, date, and categories between two sets of three hyphens. 

Change the title and the date to match the post. Then, write the post. You can use [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to help.
