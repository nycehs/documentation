In HTML, headers are given different weights. H1 is for titles, H2 for the second nested tier of headers, H3 for the tier below that, et cetera.

For accessibility, headers should be properly nested - hierarchically. That is, an H3 must have an H2 somewhere above it. 

*H1 should be used only for the data story's title (overlaid upon the title image).
*H2 should be for major section headers (including the text's first header).
*H3 should be used for subsection headers (if necessary).

Other guidelines for proper header use:
*Limit them to one line - especially avoiding single dangling words on a second line.
*Keep the headers as powerful as headlines. A user quickly scrolling the story without reading the text should still be able to get the barest, clearest main message by reading the headers.
*For subsection headers, keep the sections small - and use headers to distinguish several sections (e.g., don't have a single instance of an H3).
