You can create new posts in this site by coping a markdown file in the _posts folder.

Use the same file naming convention - YYYY-MM-DD-title.markdown

Edit the file in a text editor like Notepad++. Update the "front matter" - in a text editor, look at the top of the page, and see things like leyout, title, date, and categories between two sets of three hyphens. Change the title and the date to match the post.

Then, write the post. 

You can use [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to help.
