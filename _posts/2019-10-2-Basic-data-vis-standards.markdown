The data visualization that we include in data stories should always be impactful. 

This means that we need to distinguish data visualization that reports a dataset from data visualization that communicates key points within it.

Data visualization that communicates should have a main message, and should be designed to reinforce that main message. Use color to highlight the main message, or make a data series or point stand out.

Always use an interpretive title that tells the audience what they should conclude from the chart. Use this the same way that the data stories use strong, direct headers.

For good guidance on data visualiation, see the [Evergreen Data Visualization Checklist](https://stephanieevergreen.com/updated-data-visualization-checklist/), which follows many of the same evidence-based design guidelines from the [CDC Clear Communication Index](https://www.cdc.gov/ccindex/tool/index.html).
